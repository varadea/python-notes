Data warehouse -- a storing place where we collect the data from multiple sources.
OLTP --- online transaction processing (Transactional data)
OLAP --- online analytical processing (Analytical data)

Big data -- data which is beyond storage and processing capacity of conventional databases like oracle, SQL server,.

Sourcse of big data --
-----------------------
social  networking sites : facebook, whatsapp, twitter,linked in rct..
mobiile devices : calls data, text data, apps,etc..
internet transactions : purchases , online banking activities etc..
networked devices/sensors : temparaature, wheather etc..

Characteristics of big data  (5 'v')
-----------------------------
volume (size of data)
velocity (processing  speedo of data is fast)
variety (diff types of data/ unstructured data like,  text,images,videoas are included in BD)
value (worth  of data being extracted)
veracity (how accurate is all this data ?)


Three types of data 
---------------------

1. Structured data : data which can be easily stored/read in a tabular format using any traditional RDBMS like 
                   oracle,SQL server Ex: Employee data 

2. Semi structured data : Data  which has some structure but cannot be stored in ttabular format in RDBMS.
                        EX: Xml data, emails messagges etc..

3. Unstructured data:  Data which is not having any structure and also we cannot store in tabular format.
                     Ex: video  files, audio files, text files etc..


Hadoop:
------------------------
Hadoop is a free (open source), java based framework used for storing and processing huge data.sponsered by Apche foundation
Hadoop uese commodity (cheaper) hardware and cluster  concepts.
Hadoop is  recommended to handel big data sets (big data) and not smll data sets.
conventional databases like oracle, SQL server are not compatible to handle Big data thats why we use Hadoop to
process and handel Big data.
