-as tester we are never going to  design a table(structure)

the table struucture thats normalised/denormalised table structure is
designed data architectures/designer experinced persons  

-------------------------------------------------------------
denormalised                                  normalised

for fetching data denormalised       but  its difficult to fetch 
data tables is easy                  data  from normalised data as 
                                     there are many table so it is
                                     compplx
 
occupies large storage space         occupies small storage space 

performance is bad when data         performance is good when data 
is in denormalised form              is in normalised form
-------------------------------------------------


denormaised data - is suitable for analytical purpose

-----------------------------------------
database design is done by person having that much knowledge or
experince perticularly database engineer/designer


------------------------------------
what is partial n Transitive dependency?
--------------
study only 1 2 3 NF 

Sir i have never done the normalisation but i am aware about the
different forms of normalazation process 

database design (normalisation/denormalisation) done by architacture

------------------------------
which data form is suitable for the OLAP-analytical process and
which data form is suitable for the OLTP-transactional process?

-------------------------------------
 fully dapendant data - we cannot seperate the this data as it is 
logilly not correct, like OUR id n name columns ,so when some data
is dependant on othr  data is  can said fully DD

and partially dependant dat - is also dependant but its not completly
dependant so the PD data (col) is seperable from the table

------------------------
whos responsible for the doing normalisation database design?
-> Architecture

 ----------------------------------
1.conceptual n logical models are developed by  architecture 
2.on basis of logical model - physical model developed by devolper
3.After that this physical model - tested by the tester acco to mapping document 

------------------------------------------

1 server --> 1 Database --> 1 Schema --> 1 table

means in one server  like SSMS/Oracle multiple datbases,schemas,
tables exists but in one server(ssms) - only one db, schemas,
tables exists mean there cannot be tables db shemas of same name 

unique db,schema,tables exists -in server
------------------------

1.IN single databse server - can sreate multiple databases
  but cannot create databases of same name - throuh error
  multiple Databases be created on same server with - diff names

2.in one Database - only one type schema exist 

-----------------------------------------
1.database name
2.table name
3.column name 
4.data type 
5.data length
6.constraints

Testing ->
check (db design) maching with - mapping document or not
Pass
data type is not matching with logical model

-----------------------------------
1.Relational data model - random relation bw tables (OLTP)
2.Dimentional data model - proper relation bw tables (OLAP)
   logical arrangement of data - looks like Cube

  data arrengement in  graph on x & y axis ->  where one axis has = facts(changing),
  one axis = Dimensions(stable) mostly dimensions doesnt change frequently 
  compared to facts which are always changing

Graph: X axis = facts  Y axis = Dimensions
       X axis =  Dimensions  Y axis = facts
--------------------------------
1.fact - measurable and counted events
2.dimention - refertional information about our facts

Dimentional data model - only 2 types table fact/dimension tables


some numbers are- countable & some non-countable
   Quantity: 5+5=10 <-- facts (countable)
   but some no like mob no,addhar no also 
   have numbera but this numbers are not countable - not facts

----------------------------
#peimary keys are persent in dimention tables and its foeign keys are present in fact table.
*set of foreign keys in fact table = known dimension key

----------------------------------
#create physical & logical model?

-----------------------
in 'Customer' table 'Title' column data lenght is 'nvarchar(8)'
in 'Customer' table 'Title' column data lenght should be 'nvarchar(9)''
